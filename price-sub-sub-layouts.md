**StylePrice** — The choices are:
* Simple — The symbol, left side of the price, and right side of the price are all the same size
* Simple-bold —  Same as Simple, except the symbol and price (both left and right sides) are bolded
* Superior — The symbol and the right side are half size, and top aligned

**NumericCharWidth** —  **Not required.** This is needed only if (a)&nbsp;**PriceStyle** is set to _Superior_ **and** (b)&nbsp;the results look like they require tweaking. The value is the width of one numeric character at the **PriceFontSize**.
